Rosalind is a platform for presenting code challenges that relate directly to 
bioinformatics http://rosalind.info/about/

As a biologist who loves computation, this is irresistable. As someone with
some (and wanting to acquire more) experience in optimizing algorithms, I'll
try to write fast, descriptive, implementations to the best of my ability.

Rosalind problems are not numbered like Porject Euler, I may attempt to
organize the scripts for this project according to topic, but that may change.
