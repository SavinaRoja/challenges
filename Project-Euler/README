Project Euler is an excellent resource for learning about mathematics and
programming. Read more about it on the website at http://projecteuler.net/

I have explored solutions in both Python and C; and did some work with using C
as an extension to Python. 

Some code recipes have been made into the "pemaths" module, and the solutions
may depend on it.
